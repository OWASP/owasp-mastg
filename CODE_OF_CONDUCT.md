# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Misusing the context of the Mobile Application Security project for commercial goals (e.g. adding sales pitches to the guide or to communication channels used by the project, such as Slack).
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Disclaimer

The OWAPS MAS and its materials are conceived for educational and research purposes only, or if you are a professional security tester that is analyzing mobile apps with approval of the app owner (e.g. as part of a penetration test or a bug bounty program).

Refrain from violating the laws in your country by carefully consulting them before executing any tests against mobile apps when utilizing the OWAPS MAS materials.

The OWAPS MAS project is also NOT supporting unethical activities in any way. If you come across such requests, please reach out to the project leaders and raise this to them.

Neither OWASP, the OWAPS MAS project leaders, authors or anyone else involved in this project is going to take responsibility for your actions.

The intention of the OWAPS MAS project is not to encourage hacking or malicious activities! Instead, the goal of the project is to document different attacks against mobile apps and its risk, and offer ways to reduce or mitigate that risk.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community includes using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at sven.schleier@owasp.org and carlos.holguera@owasp.org.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
