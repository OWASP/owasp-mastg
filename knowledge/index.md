The Mobile Application Security Knowledge Base is a collection of knowledge articles that provide detailed information on various aspects of mobile application security. It includes general security concepts, platform-specific features and APIs, as well as detailed explanations and references.

The knowledge base is designed to be a comprehensive resource for security professionals, developers, and testers who are looking to enhance their understanding of mobile application security. From cryptographic practices, data storage techniques, deep links, to network security, the knowledge base covers a wide range of topics relevant to mobile security.

The articles are organized into categories, making it easy to navigate and find specific information. They are also linked to other MASTG components, such as tests, techniques or tools, providing a holistic view of mobile application security practices.

The knowledge base is continuously updated to reflect the latest security trends, best practices, and platform updates. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone involved in mobile application security, whether you are a developer looking to implement secure coding practices, a tester conducting security assessments, or a security professional seeking to stay informed about the latest threats and mitigation strategies.
