title: Dumping KeyChain Data
platform: ios
---

Dumping the KeyChain data can be done with multiple tools, but not all of them will work on any iOS version. As is more often the case, try the different tools or look up their documentation for information on the latest supported versions.

## Objection (Jailbroken / non-Jailbroken)

The KeyChain data can easily be viewed using Objection. First, connect objection to the @MASTG-APP-0028 app as described in "Recommended Tools - Objection". Then, use the `ios keychain dump` command to get an overview of the keychain:

```bash
$ objection --name "iGoat-Swift" start
... [usb] # ios keychain dump
...
Note: You may be asked to authenticate using the devices passcode or TouchID
Save the output by adding `--json keychain.json` to this command

Note that currently, the latest versions of frida-server and objection do not correctly decode all keychain data. Different combinations can be tried to increase compatibility. For example, the previous printout was created with `frida-tools==1.3.0`, `frida==12.4.8` and `objection==1.5.0`.

Finally, since the keychain dumper is executed from within the application context, it will only print out keychain items that can be accessed by the application and **not** the entire keychain of the iOS device.

## Grapefruit (Jailbroken / non-Jailbroken)

With @MASTG-TOOL-0061 it's possible to access the keychain data of the app you have selected. Inside the **Storage** section, click on **Keychain** and you can see a listing of the stored Keychain information.

## Keychain-dumper (Jailbroken)

You can use @MASTG-TOOL-0056 to dump the jailbroken device's KeyChain contents. Once you have it running on your device:

```bash
iPhone:~ root# /tmp/keychain_dumper

(...)

In newer versions of iOS (iOS 11 and up), additional steps are necessary. See the README.md for more details.
Note that this binary is signed with a self-signed certificate that has a "wildcard" entitlement. The entitlement grants access to _all_ items in the Keychain. If you are paranoid or have very sensitive private data on your test device, you may want to build the tool from source and manually sign the appropriate entitlements into your build; instructions for doing this are available in the GitHub repository.
