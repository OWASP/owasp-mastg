title: Extracting Information from the Application Binary
---

You can use radare to get information about the binary, such as the architecture, the list of shared libraries, the list of classes and methods, strings and more.

Let's use the [Damn Vulnerable iOS App DVIA v1](https://github.com/prateek147/DVIA/) as an example. Open its main binary with radare2:

```bash
r2 DamnVulnerableIOSApp
```

## Binary Information

To get information about the binary, you can use the `i` command. This command will list information about the binary, such as the architecture, the list of shared libraries, the list of classes and methods, strings and more.

```bash
[0x1000180c8]> i
...
size     0x43d5f0
humansz  4.2M
mode     r-x
format   mach064
iorw     false
block    0x100
packet   xtr.fatmach0
...
lang     objc with blocks
linenum  false
lsyms    false
nx       false
os       ios
pic      true
relocs   true
sanitize false
static   false
stripped true
```

## Classes and Methods

And then we can proceed to extract information about the methods in the application's source code. To do this, we need to load the application binary into radare and then list the classes and methods in the binary.

```bash
[0x1000180c8]> icc

...

@interface SFAntiPiracy : NSObject
{
}
+ (int) isPirated
+ (int) isJailbroken
+ (void) killApplication
+ (bool) isTheDeviceJailbroken
+ (bool) isTheApplicationCracked
+ (bool) isTheApplicationTamperedWith
+ (int) urlCheck
...
@end
```

Note the plus sign, which means that this is a class method that returns a BOOL type.
A minus sign would mean that this is an instance method. Refer to later sections to understand the practical difference between these.

## Linked Libraries

The following command is listing shared libraries:

```bash
[0x1000180c8]> il
[Linked libraries]

```

## Strings

Obtaining strings is very useful when reverse engineering an app because it can give you a lot of information about the app's functionality. For example, you can find URLs, API endpoints, encryption keys, and more. You can also find strings that will point you to interesting functions, such as the login function or a function that checks whether the device is jailbroken.

```bash
[0x1000180c8]> izz~cstring | less
