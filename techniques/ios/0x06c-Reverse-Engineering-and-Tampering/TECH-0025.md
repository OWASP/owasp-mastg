title: Repackaging and Re-Signing
---

Of course, tampering an app invalidates the main executable's code signature, so this won't run on a non-jailbroken device. You'll need to replace the provisioning profile and sign both the main executable and the files you've made include (e.g. `FridaGadget.dylib`) with the certificate listed in the profile.

## Repackaging

First, let's add our own provisioning profile to the package:

```bash
cp AwesomeRepackaging.mobileprovision Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/embedded.mobileprovision
```

Next, we need to make sure that the Bundle ID in `Info.plist` matches the one specified in the profile because the codesign tool will read the Bundle ID from `Info.plist` during signing; the wrong value will lead to an invalid signature.

```bash
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleIdentifier sg.vantagepoint.repackage" Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/Info.plist
```

## Re-Signing

Finally, we use the codesign tool to re-sign both binaries. You need to use _your own_ signing identity (in this example 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938), which you can output by executing the command `security find-identity -v`.

```bash
$ rm -rf Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/_CodeSignature
$ /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938  Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/FridaGadget.dylib
Payload/UnCrackable Level 1.app/FridaGadget.dylib: replacing existing signature
```

`entitlements.plist` is the file you created for your empty iOS project.

```bash
$ /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938 --entitlements entitlements.plist Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1
Payload/UnCrackable Level 1.app/UnCrackable Level 1: replacing existing signature
```

Now you should be ready to run the modified app. Deploy and run the app on the device using [ios-deploy](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#ios-deploy):

```bash
ios-deploy --debug --bundle Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/
```

If everything went well, the app should start in debugging mode with LLDB attached. Frida should then be able to attach to the app as well. You can verify this via the frida-ps command:

```bash
$ frida-ps -U
PID  Name
---  ------
499  Gadget
```

When something goes wrong (and it usually does), mismatches between the provisioning profile and code-signing header are the most likely causes. Reading the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/ "Code Signing") helps you understand the code-signing process. Apple's [entitlement troubleshooting page](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2415/_index.html "Entitlements Troubleshooting") is also a useful resource.
