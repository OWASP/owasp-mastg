title: Library Injection

If you want to use Frida on non-jailbroken devices you'll need to include `FridaGadget.dylib`. Download it first:

```bash
curl -O https://build.frida.re/frida/ios/lib/FridaGadget.dylib
```

Copy `FridaGadget.dylib` into the app directory and use [optool](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#optool) to add a load command to the "UnCrackable Level 1" binary.

```bash
$ unzip UnCrackable-Level1.ipa
$ cp FridaGadget.dylib Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/
$ optool install -c load -p "@executable_path/FridaGadget.dylib"  -t Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1

## Patching Example: Making an App Debuggable

By default, an app available on the Apple App Store is not debuggable. In order to debug an iOS application, it must have the `get-task-allow` entitlement enabled. This entitlement allows other processes (like a debugger) to attach to the app. Xcode is not adding the `get-task-allow` entitlement in a distribution provisioning profile; it is only whitelisted and added in a development provisioning profile.

Thus, to debug an iOS application obtained from the App Store, it needs to be re-signed with a development provisioning profile with the `get-task-allow` entitlement. How to re-sign an application is discussed in the next section.
