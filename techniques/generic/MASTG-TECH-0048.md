For white-box source code testing, you'll need a setup similar to the developer's setup, including a test environment that includes the Android SDK and an IDE. Access to either a physical device or an emulator (for debugging the app) is recommended.

During **black-box testing**, you won't have access to the original form of the source code. You'll usually have the application package in [Android's APK format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apk_(file_format) "APK file format"), which can be installed on an Android device or reverse engineered as explained in @MASTG-TECH-0017.
