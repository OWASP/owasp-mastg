title: Testing Emulator Detection
---

## Overview

In order to test for emulator detection you can try to run the app on different emulators as indicated in section ["Emulator Detection"](#emulator-detection) and see what happens.

The app should respond in some way. For example by:

- Alerting the user and asking for accepting liability.
- Preventing execution by gracefully terminating.
- Reporting to a backend server, e.g, for fraud detection.

You can also reverse engineer the app using ideas for strings and methods from section ["Emulator Detection"](#emulator-detection).

Next, work on bypassing this detection and answer the following questions:

- Can the mechanisms be bypassed trivially (e.g., by hooking a single API function)?
- How difficult is identifying the detection code via static and dynamic analysis?
- Did you need to write custom code to disable the defenses? How much time did you need?
- What is your assessment of the difficulty of bypassing the mechanisms?
