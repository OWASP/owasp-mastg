A lot has happened & we are happy to announce that version 1.1 of the MASVS got released! Not just in English, but in Spanish and Russian as well. Want to know more? [check the releases](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases)!. We would like to thank our Russian and Spanish speaking volunteers that have put quite some effort in translating the document! Lastly, we would like to announce that not all minor version releases will be in this news-section, unless something really important changed. Do you want to have the latest version of the MASVS? Just check Github!
