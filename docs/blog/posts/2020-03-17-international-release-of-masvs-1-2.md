A new version of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Standard (MASVS) was released! The MASVS establishes baseline security requirements for mobile apps and summarizes them in one standard. With this new release we achieved a significant alignment and coverage with existing mobile security documents from ENISA, older NIST documents, OWASP Mobile top 10, and others. The new version 1.2 is available in Github Releases: <https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/tag/v1.2>. For more details please look into our Release Notes for Version 1.2 and Version 1.2-RC <https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg/releases/tag/v1.2>.

The project team (Sven Schleier, Jeroen Willemsen and Carlos Holguera) would like to thank all the contributors, translators and those who build the improved automation around it and all their hard work and support in the last few months! New releases will be much faster thanks to our GitHub actions and Docker containers. Next to that, we are happy to add Korean and Chinese Simplified to our ever growing list of translations! We will finalize the document generation system and then apply the same build system to the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) in order to speed up the release process and release more frequently.
