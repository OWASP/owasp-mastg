The Mobile App Security Verification Standard (MASVS) has undergone a major revision, including a re-design of the security model and verification levels. We also revised many security requirements to address the multitude of [issues raised on GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20). The result is MASVS v0.9.2, which is now [available for download](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/tag/0.9.2) in PDF format.

As the MASVS is nearing maturity, we have decided to freeze the requirements until the Mobile Testing Guide and checklists "catch up" (due to the one-to-one mapping between requirements in the MASVS and MSTG, changes to the requirements make it necessary to update the other documents as well, causing repeated effort). Unless major issues pop up, the current list will therefore remain in place until MASVS/MSTG v1.0, and further changes will be reserved for v1.1 or later releases.

The MASVS is a community effort to establish security requirements for designing, developing and testing secure mobile apps on iOS and Android.
