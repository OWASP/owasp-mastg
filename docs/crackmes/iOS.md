## iOS UnCrackable L1

A secret string is hidden somewhere in this binary. Find a way to extract it. The app will give you a hint when started.

<a href="https://github.com/OWASP/mastg/raw/master/Crackmes/iOS/Level_01/UnCrackable-Level1.ipa" class="mas-chip">Download</a>

??? info "Installation"
    Open the "Device" window in Xcode and drag the IPA file into the list below "Installed Apps".

    Note: The IPA is signed with an Enterprise distribution certificate. You'll need to install the provisioning profile and trust the developer to run the app the "normal" way. Alternatively, re-sign the app with your own certificate, or run it on a jailbroken device (you'll want to do one of those anyway to crack it).

## iOS UnCrackable L2

This app holds a secret inside - and this time it won't be tampered with!

Hint: it is related to alcoholic beverages.

<a href="https://github.com/OWASP/mastg/raw/master/Crackmes/iOS/Level_02/UnCrackable-Level2.ipa" class="mas-chip">Download</a>

??? info "Installation"
    Open the "Device" window in Xcode and drag the IPA file into the list below "Installed Apps".

    Note 1: The IPA is signed with an Enterprise distribution certificate. You'll need to install the provisioning profile and trust the developer to run the app the "normal" way. Alternatively, re-sign the app with your own certificate, or run it on a jailbroken device (you'll want to do one of those anyway to crack it).

    Note 2: Due to its anti-tampering mechanisms the app won't run correctly if the main executable is modified and/or re-signed.
