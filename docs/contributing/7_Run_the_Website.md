# How to Run the OWASP MAS Website Locally

This guide will help you set up and run the OWASP MAS website locally on your machine. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Using Docker

The easiest way to run the website is by using Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/mastg.git
cd mastg
docker build . -t mastg
docker run --name mastg -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/workspaces/mastg mastg
```

This will make the website available on `http://localhost:8000`. By default, interactions with the Github api are disabled, which means some dynamically retrieved content will not be available. If you want to enable the Github API, [create a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) and export it as an environment variable. Make sure docker can access the token by using `-e GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
docker run --name mastg -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -e GITHUB_TOKEN -v $(pwd):/workspaces/mastg mastg
```

## Without Docker

> **TLDR for advanced users:**
>
> - Clone the MASTG, MASVS and MASWE repos
> - Set up a virtual environment
> - Install dependencies from `src/scripts/requirements.txt`
> - Add your token as an environment variable: [`export GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN>`](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)
> - Run the website using `./run_web.sh`

### Prerequisites

Before running the website, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (vscode)

[Create a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) on Github and export this token as environment variable (e.g. in your .zshrc file):

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

Alternatively, you can add your token inside of the `run_web.sh` script. Open the script in a code editor for more information.

### Step 1: Clone the OWASP MAS Repositories

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/mastg.git
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/masvs.git
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/maswe.git
```

**Note:** We'll just work with the `OWASP/mastg` repo, but the `OWASP/masvs` and `OWASP/maswe` are required for the website to run.

### Step 2: Open the OWASP MASTG Repository in vscode

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd mastg
code .
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv) to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

Use vscode's [`Command Palette`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (Press `⌘+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)

1. Create a venv:
    - Press `⌘+Shift+P` -> `Python: Create Environment`
    - Select `"Quick Create"`
2. Select the venv as the Python interpreter:
    - Press `⌘+Shift+P` -> `Python: Select Interpreter`
    - Choose the venv you just created.
3. Install the dependencies
   - Press `⌘+j` to open the terminal
   - Run `pip install -r src/scripts/requirements.txt`

### Step 4: Run the Website

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./run_web.sh
```

The script simply runs `mkdocs serve` with some additional arguments. Open the script in a code editor for more information.

Access the website at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Step 5: Debugging the Website

To debug the website:

- Go to `Run and Debug` in vscode (or press `⌘+Shift+D` on macOS)
- Select `Python: MkDocs Serve`
- Click the green play button to start debugging
- Set breakpoints in the code as needed
