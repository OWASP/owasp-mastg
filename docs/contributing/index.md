## üö´ What not to do

Although we greatly appreciate any and all contributions to the project, there are a few things that you should take into consideration:

- **No advertisement**: The OWASP mobile Security Project cannot be used as a platform for advertisement of commercial tools, companies or individuals. Technical content such as the implementation of certain techniques or tests should be written with free and open-source tools in mind. Commercial tools are typically not accepted, but might be referenced in some specific cases.
- **No unnecessary self-promotion of tools or blog posts**: If you have a relation with one of the URLs or tools you are referencing, please state so in the PR so that we can verify that the reference is in line with the rest of the guide.

Please be sure to take a careful look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OWASP/mastg/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md "Code of Conduct") for all the details and [ask us](../contact.md) in case of doubt.

## Tool Inclusion Disclaimer for Contributors

OWASP MASTG encourages community contributions, including security testing tools that provide clear and practical value. However, all tool submissions are subject to review and may be rejected if they appear to be self-promotional, lack relevance, or do not meet minimum quality standards (e.g., documentation, usability, maintenance).

To be considered for inclusion, tools should be:

- Open source or freely accessible
- Clearly documented and usable by the community
- Actively maintained, with updates tracking Android and iOS platform changes whenever applicable

Even after inclusion, tools are subject to removal if they become outdated, broken, unmaintained, or otherwise no longer align with the goals of the MASTG. Inclusion is not permanent and does not imply endorsement by OWASP.

In instances where no suitable open-source alternative exists, we may include closed-source tools. However, any closed-source tools included must be free to use, as we aim to avoid featuring paid tools whenever possible. This also extends to freeware or community editions of commercial tools.

Our goal is to be vendor-neutral and to serve as a trusted learning resource, which is why we've **avoid the inclusion of "automated mobile application security scanners"** due to the competitive challenges they pose. Instead, we focus on tools that provide full code access and comprehensive testing, as they are better suited for educational purposes. Tools that lack this transparency, even if they offer a free version, typically do not meet the OWASP MAS project's inclusion criteria.
