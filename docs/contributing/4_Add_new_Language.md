## MASTG Translations

The MASTG is a living document that changes and adapts to the most recent security recommendations every day. While we do want to reach the maximum audience possible, our past experience shows that **maintaining translations has proven to be an extremely challenging task**. Therefore, please understand that **any PRs containing MASTG translations will be declined**, but you're free to do them on your own forks.

> 🇯🇵 A translation of the MASTG into Japanese is available on Github: <https://github.com/coky-t/owasp-mstg-ja>. Thanks to @coky-t for pushing this forward!

## MASVS Translations

Starting with MASVS v2.0.0, translations will no longer be included to focus on the development of MASTG v2.0.0. We encourage the community to create and maintain their own translations. Thank you to all the past translators who generously volunteered their time and expertise to make the MASVS accessible to non-English speaking communities. We truly appreciate your contributions and hope to continue working together in the future. The past MASVS v1.5.0 translations are still available in the [MASVS repo](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/tag/v1.5.0).
