# How Can You Contribute?

You can directly contribute to the MASVS, MASWE, or MASTG in many different ways!

## Contribution Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A(Open Discussion) -->|discuss| C{qualifies?}
    C -->|Yes| D(Issue)
    C -->|No| E[Close]
    D -->|open PR| F(Pull Request)
    F -->|review| G{approved?}
    F -->|make changes| F
    G -->|Yes| H[Merge]
    G -->|No| I[Close]
```

Typically, contributors should follow the entire process. However, sometimes it's clear what's needed, so we create an issue or open a PR directly. We recommend starting with a discussion to save you from the hassle of writing and submitting content that does not qualify, which would result in it being rejected after the work is done.
