# Add a Crackme

The MAS project is a powerful learning resource and the MAS Crackmes are no exception. They allow the MAS community not only to practice the MAS skills they've learned from the MASTG but also let them confirm their approaches to the used techniques, especially when performing reverse engineering.

## Who Can Contribute with a Crackme?

Anyone from individuals to companies. You only hace to read and accepts the Terms and Conditions listed below.

**Before submitting a crackme**, first of all contact the MAS team here: <https://mas.owasp.org/contact/>

## Terms and Conditions
