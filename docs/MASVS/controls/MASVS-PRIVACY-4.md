# MASVS-PRIVACY-4

## Control

The app offers user control over their data.

## Description

Users should have control over their data. This control ensures that apps provide mechanisms for users to manage, delete, and modify their data, and change privacy settings as needed (e.g. to revoke consent). Additionally, apps should re-prompt for consent and update their transparency disclosures when they require more data than initially specified.
