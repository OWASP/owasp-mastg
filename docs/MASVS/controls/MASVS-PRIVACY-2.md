# MASVS-PRIVACY-2

## Control

The app prevents identification of the user.

## Description

Protecting user identity is crucial. This control emphasizes the use of unlinkability techniques like data abstraction, anonymization and pseudonymization to prevent user identification and tracking.

Another key aspect addressed by this control is to establish technical barriers when employing complex 'fingerprint-like' signals (e.g. device IDs, IP addresses, behavioral patterns) for specific purposes. For instance, a fingerprint used for fraud detection should be isolated and not repurposed for audience measurement in an analytics SDK. This ensures that each data stream serves its intended function without risking user privacy.
