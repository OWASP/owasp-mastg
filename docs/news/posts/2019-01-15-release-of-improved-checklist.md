## Release of Improved Checklist

We released a new version of the checklist! This version has adaptable references so that it can be used with newer versions of the MSTG as well. This version is currently available in French and English and we hope to add the Russian, Japanese, German and Spanish version soon! Want to know more? Take a look at [our release page](https://github.com/OWASP/mastg/releases/tag/1.1-excel)!. We would like to thank our volunteers for their effort to deliver these easy to use checklists!
