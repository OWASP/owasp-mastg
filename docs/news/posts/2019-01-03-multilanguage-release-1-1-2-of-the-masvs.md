We released the 1.1.2 version of the OWASP MASVS! This is the first version in Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish! Exactly: we just added French, German, Japanese and Chinese! Obviously this would not be possible without all the volunteers that helped us with translations, feedback, updating, and automating the release process! We are grateful for the awesome team that pulled this off! Want to see the result? Take a look at [our release page](https://github.com/OWASP/masvs/releases/tag/1.1.2)!
