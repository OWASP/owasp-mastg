We're bringing official colors to the MASVS! The new colors will be used across the MASVS v2.0.0 and MASTG v2.0.0 to help users quickly identify the different control groups. We've also revamped certain areas of our website to make them more readable and easier to navigate as well as to prepare for what's coming with the MASTG v2.0.0 (keyword: "atomic tests").

### MASVS

In the MASVS home page, the new colors will be used to highlight the different control groups.

</center>

The individual controls will also be color-coded to help users quickly identify the different control groups. We've also redesigned the control pages to make them more readable and easier to navigate.

### MASTG

Now, when you navigate to the MASTG tests, you'll see that they are categorized by platform (Android/iOS) as well as by MASVS category, also using our new colors in the sidebar. The colors will also be used to highlight the different control groups in the test description.

Each test now contains a header section indicating the platform, the MASVS v1.5.0 controls, and the MASVS v2.0.0 controls.

</center>

We've also introduced a new section called "Resources" which is automatically generated using the inline links within the MASTG pages and serve as a quick reference to the most important resources for each test.

**NOTE:** The MASTG tests themselves haven't changed yet, we're still working on the refactoring. For now we've simply split the tests into individual pages to make them easier to navigate and reference. This will facilitate the work on the refactoring and the introduction of the new atomic tests.

### MAS Checklist

The MAS Checklist pages and the MAS checklist itself have also been updated to use the new colors to highlight the different control groups and to make them easier to navigate.

</center>

When you click on a MASVS group you'll see a table listing the new MASVS v2.0.0 controls as well as the corresponding MASTG tests (v1.5.0) for both the Android and the iOS platforms.

</center>

**NOTE:** The checklist contains the old MASVS v1 verification levels (L1, L2 and R) which we are currently reworking into "security testing profiles". The levels were assigned according to the MASVS v1 ID that the test was previously covering and might differ in the upcoming version of the MASTG and MAS Checklist.

For the upcoming of the MASTG version we will progressively split the MASTG tests into smaller tests, the so-called "atomic tests" and assign the new MAS profiles accordingly.
