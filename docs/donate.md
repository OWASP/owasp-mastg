# Donations

While both the MASVS and the MASTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help is required.

**Monetary Donations:** You can donate any amount you like, no matter how small, anyone can help. From 500$ up you may select a [Donation Package](donate/packages.md) and be listed as a donator.

100% of the funds go to the OWASP Foundation and allow us funding our project activities such as contracting technical editors, graphic designers, software developers, purchasing test devices, creating swag, etc.

**Effort Based:** You can instead support the project by contributing with your work and end up at our [acknowledgement section](MASTG/Intro/0x02c-Acknowledgements.md "MASTG acknowledgements").

If you're a company, consider becoming a ["MAS Advocate"](MASTG/Intro/0x02c-Acknowledgements.md#our-mas-advocates) which is the highest status that companies can achieve in the project acknowledging that they've gone above and beyond to support the project.
