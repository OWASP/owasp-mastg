## About the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for testing the security of mobile apps. It describes processes and techniques for verifying the requirements listed in the [Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs), and provides a baseline for complete and consistent security tests.

OWASP thanks the many authors, reviewers, and editors for their hard work in developing this guide. If you have any comments or suggestions on the Mobile Security Testing Guide, please join the discussion around MASVS and MSTG in the [OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/). You can sign up for the Slack channel at [http://owasp.herokuapp.com/](http://owasp.herokuapp.com/).
