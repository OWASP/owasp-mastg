### Testing Advanced Root Detection

#### Overview

The goal of root detection (in the context of reverse engineering defense) is to make it a bit more difficult to run the app on a rooted device, which in turn impedes some tools and techniques reverse engineers like to use. As with most other defenses, root detection is not a very effective on its own, but having some root checks sprinkled throughout the app can improve the effectiveness of the overall anti-tampering scheme.

On Android, we define the term "root detection" a bit more broadly to include detection of custom ROMs, i.e. verifying whether the device is a stock Android build or not.

##### Common Root Detection Methods

###### SafetyNet

SafetyNet is an Android API that creates a profile of the device using software and hardware information. This profile is then compared against a list of white-listed device models that have passed Android compatibility testing. In part, this is meant to asses to be used to assess the integrity and safety of the device. Google recommends using the feature as "an additional in-depth defense signal as part of an anti-abuse system" [1].

What exactly SafetyNet does under the hood is not well documented, and may change at any time: When you call this API, the service actually downloads a binary package containing the device vaidation code from Google, which is then dynamically executed using reflection. Some analysis shows that the checks performed by SafetyNet also attempt to detect whether the device is rooted, although it is unclear how extacly this is determined [2].

To use the API, an app may the SafetyNetApi.attest() method with returns a JWS message with the *Attestation Result*, and then check the following fields:

- ctsProfileMatch: Of "true", the device profile matches one of Google's listed devices that have passed  Android compatibility testing.
- basicIntegrity: The device running the app likely wasn't tampered with.

~~~
{
  "nonce": "R2Rra24fVm5xa2Mg",
  "timestampMs": 9860437986543,
  "apkPackageName": "com.package.name.of.requesting.app",
  "apkCertificateDigestSha256": ["base64 encoded, SHA-256 hash of the
                                  certificate used to sign requesting app"],
  "apkDigestSha256": "base64 encoded, SHA-256 hash of the app's APK",
  "ctsProfileMatch": true,
  "basicIntegrity": true,
}
~~~

###### Self-made Checks

**File checks**

Checking for the existance of files typically found on rooted devices is a very common method. This includes app packages of common rooting tools such as Superuser:

~~~
/system/app/Superuser.apk
~~~

One could also attempt to detect binaries that are usually installed once a device is rooted. Examples include checking for the *su* binary at different locations. Su is usually found in the following locations:

~~~
/sbin/su
/system/bin/su
/system/xbin/su
/system/xbin/busybox
/data/local/su
/data/local/xbin/su
~~~ 

**Executing su and other commands**

Another way of determining whether su exists is attempting to execute it through Runtime.getRuntime.exec(). This will throw an IOException if su is not in PATH. The same method can be used to check for other programs often found on rooted devices, such as busybox or the symbolic links that typically point to it.

**Checking running processes**

Su on Android depends on a background process called *daemonsu*, so the presence of process is another sign of a rooted device. Running processes can be enumerated through ActivityManager.getRunningAppProcesses() API, the *ps* command, or walking through the */proc* directory.

**Checking installed app packages**

The Android package manager can be used to obtain a list of installed packages.

~~~
com.thirdparty.superuser
eu.chainfire.supersu
com.noshufou.android.su
com.koushikdutta.superuser
com.zachspong.temprootremovejb
com.ramdroid.appquarantine
~~~

**Checking for writable partitions and system directories**

Unusual permissions on system directories can indicate a customized or rooted device. While under normal circumstances, the system and data directories are always mounted as readonly, you'll sometimes find them mounted as read-write when the device is rooted. This can be tested for by checking whether these filesystems have been mounted with the "rw" flag, or attempting to create a file in these directories

**Checking for custom Android builds**

Besides checking whether the device is rooted, it is also helpful to check for signs of test builds and custom ROMs. One method of doing this is checking whether the BUILD tag contains test-keys, which normally indicates a custom Android image [5]. This can be checked as follows [6]:

~~~
private boolean isTestKeyBuild()
{
String str = Build.TAGS;
if ((str != null) && (str.contains("test-keys")));
for (int i = 1; ; i = 0)
  return i;
}
~~~

Missing Google Over-The-Air (OTA) certificates are another sign of a custom ROM, as on stock Android builds, OTA updates use Google's public certificates [3].

#### Static Analysis

Check the original or decompiled source code for the presence of root detection mechanisms, and compare them against the following criteria:

To qualify as "advanced", the scheme should not be easily bypassable using widely available tools such as RootCloak. Effective root detection should fulfill the following criteria:

- Multiple detection methods are scattered throughout the app (as opposed to using only a single check);
- The root detection mechanisms operate on multiple API layers (Java API, native functions, system calls);
- The mechanisms show some level of originality (no copy/paste from StackOverflow or other sources);
- The mechanisms are well-integrated with other defenses (e.g. root detection functions are obfuscated and protected from tampering).

#### Dynamic Analysis

Attempt to identify and bypass the root detection mechanisms implemented. You'll most likely find that a combination of the methods above, or variations of those methods, are used. If you're performing a black-box resiliency assessment, disabling all root detection mechanisms is your first step.

Run execution traces using JDB, DDMS, strace and/or Kernel modules to find out what the app is doing - you'll usually see all kinds of suspect interactions with the operating system, such as opening *su* for reading or obtaining a list of processes. These interactions are surefire signs of root detection. Identify and deactivate the root detection mechanisms one-by-one.

You can use a number of techniques to bypass these checks, most of which were introduced in the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter:

1. Renaming binaries. For example, in some cases simply renaming the "su" binary to something else is enough to defeat root detection (try not to break your enviroment though!).
2. Unmounting /proc to prevent reading of process lists etc.
2. Using Frida or Xposed to hook APIs on the Java and native layers. By doing this, you can hide files and processes, hide the actual content of files, or return all kinds of bogus values the app requests;
3. Hooking low-level APIs using Kernel modules.
4. Patching the app to remove the checks.

#### Remediation

If the root detection mechanisms are found to be insufficient, propose additional checks so the protection scheme fulfills the criteria listed above.

### Testing Debugging Defenses

#### Overview

Debugging is a highly effective way of analyzing the runtime behaviour of an app. It allows the reverse engineer to step through the code, stop execution of the app at arbitrary point, inspect the state of variables, read and modify memory, and a lot more.

As mentioned in the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter, we have to deal with two different debugging protocols on Android: One could debug on the Java level using JDWP, or on the native layer using a ptrace-based debugger. Consequently, a good anti-debugging scheme needs to have defenses against both debugger types.

Anti-debugging features can be preventive or reactive. As the name implies, preventive anti-debugging tricks prevent the debugger from attaching in the first place, while reactive tricks attempt to detect whether a debugger is present and react to it in some way (e.g. terminating the app, or triggering some kind of hidden behaviour). The "more-is-better" rule applies: To maximize effectiveness, one should combine multiple defenses that rely on different methods of prevention and detection, operate on multiple different API layers, and are distributed throughout the app. 

##### Common Anti-JDWP-Debugging Methods

**isDebuggerActive**

**Messing with memory structures**


##### Common Anti-Native-Debugging Methods


**Calling ptrace**


**Fork/ptrace**


**Breakpoint detection**


#### White-box Testing

(Describe how to assess this with access to the source code and build configuration)

#### Black-box Testing

(... TODO ... testing in basic form vs. advanced defenses)

Attach a debugger to the running process. This should either fail, or the app should terminate or misbehave when the debugger has been detected. For example, if ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH) has been called, gdb will crash with a segmentation fault:

(TODO example)

(TODO JDWP)

Note that some anti-debugging implementations respond in a stealthy way so that changes in behaviour are not immediately apparent. For example, a soft token app might not visibly respond when a debugger is detected, but instead secretly alter the state of an internal variable so that an incorrect OTP is generated at a later point. Make sure to run through the complete workflow to determine if attaching the debugger causes a crash or malfunction.
