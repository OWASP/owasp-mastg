# Overview

(... TODO ...) A brief, general overview before moving on to the OS-specific chapters.

The current state of mobile application development largely revolves around two popular platforms, Apple iOS and Google Android.

For Apple, their iOS operating system is based on Darwin (BSD). iOS runs on iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch devices. Additionally, watchOS which powers Apple Watch devices, is also closely based on iOS.

For Google, their Android operating system is based on the Linux kernel. It powers a variety of devices from smartphones, tablets, televisions and wearable devices.

Both Apple and Google have their respective digital distribution platform; for Apple this being the App Store for iOS applications and for Google, via their Play Store for Android applications.
