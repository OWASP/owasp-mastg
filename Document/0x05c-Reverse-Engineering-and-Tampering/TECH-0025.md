title: Re-Signing
---

Before re-signing, you first need a code-signing certificate. If you have built a project in Android Studio before, the IDE has already created a debug keystore and certificate in `$HOME/.android/debug.keystore`. The default password for this KeyStore is "android" and the key is called "androiddebugkey".

The standard Java distribution includes `keytool` for managing KeyStores and certificates. You can create your own signing certificate and key, then add it to the debug KeyStore:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias signkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 20000
```

After the certificate is available, you can re-sign the APK with it. Be sure that `apksigner` is in the path and that you run it from the folder where your repackaged APK is located.

```bash
apksigner sign --ks  ~/.android/debug.keystore --ks-key-alias signkey UnCrackable-Repackaged.apk
```

Note: If you experience JRE compatibility issues with `apksigner`, you can use `jarsigner` instead. When you do this, `zipalign` must be called **after** signing.

```bash
jarsigner -verbose -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore ../UnCrackable-Repackaged.apk signkey
zipalign -v 4 dist/UnCrackable-Level1.apk ../UnCrackable-Repackaged.apk
```

Now you may reinstall the app:

```bash
adb install UnCrackable-Repackaged.apk
```
