apkx is a Python wrapper to popular free DEX converters and Java decompilers. It automates the extraction, conversion, and decompilation of APKs. Install it as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muellerberndt/apkx
cd apkx
sudo ./install.sh
```

This should copy apkx to `/usr/local/bin`. See section "[Decompiling Java Code](0x05c-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering.md#decompiling-java-code "Decompiling Java Code")" of the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter for more information about usage.
