[House](https://github.com/nccgroup/house "House") is a runtime mobile application analysis toolkit for Android apps, developed and maintained by the NCC Group and is written in Python.

It's leveraging a running Frida server on a rooted device or the Frida gadget in a repackaged Android app. The intention of House is to allow an easy way of prototyping Frida scripts via its convenient web GUI.

The installation instructions and "how-to guide" of House can be found in the [Readme of the Github repo](https://github.com/nccgroup/house "Github Repo of House").
