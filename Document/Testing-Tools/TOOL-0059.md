With [ios-deploy](https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy "ios-deploy") you can install and debug iOS apps from the command line, without using Xcode. It can be installed via brew on macOS:

```bash
brew install ios-deploy
```

Alternatively:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy.git
cd ios-deploy/
xcodebuild
cd build/Release
./ios-deploy
ln -s <your-path-to-ios-deploy>/build/Release/ios-deploy /usr/local/bin/ios-deploy
```

The last line creates a symbolic link and makes the executable available system-wide. Reload your shell to make the new commands available:

```bash
zsh: # . ~/.zshrc
bash: # . ~/.bashrc
```
