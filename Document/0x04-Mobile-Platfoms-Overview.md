## Mobile Applications Overview

Mobile development has taken world to a ride and we have many different ways of developing applications for all mobile platforms.

* Native Apps:
   * **Android**: Applications are primarily written in Java by using the Android SDK. However code logic could be abstracted out as a C binary by using the Android NDK to provide low-level functionality and speed.
   * **iOS**: Primarily written in Objective C by using Xcode IDE. With introduction of Swift slowly the primary language is shifting to Swift.
* HTML5 Apps: The base for HTML5 Apps are JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 technologies. They are web sites but display effectively on mobile devices.
* Hybrid Apps: Hybrid applications are basically web applications that are rendered in the native browser of the mobile operating system, for example UIWebView in iOS or WebView in Android. The base for Hybrid-Apps are JavaScript, CSS and HTML that are packaged in a native application.

There are various frameworks which allow you to write software in one language and compile the application for multiple platforms. Examples for such frameworks are:
* [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/)
* [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
* [Kony](http://www.kony.com/)
* [B4X](https://www.b4x.com/)
