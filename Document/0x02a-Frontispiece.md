## About the OWASP MASTG

The [OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG)](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/), which is part of the [OWASP Mobile Application Security (MAS)](https://mas.owasp.org/) flagship project, is a comprehensive manual covering the processes, techniques, and tools used during mobile application security analysis, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases for verifying the requirements listed in the [OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/), providing a baseline for complete and consistent security tests.

The OWASP MASVS and MASTG are trusted by the following platform providers and standardization, governmental and educational institutions. [Learn more](0x02b-MASVS-MASTG-Adoption.md).

### Bernhard Mueller

Bernhard is a cyber security specialist with a talent for hacking systems of all kinds. During more than a decade in the industry, he has published many zero-day exploits for software such as MS SQL Server, Adobe Flash Player, IBM Director, Cisco VOIP, and ModSecurity. If you can name it, he has probably broken it at least once. BlackHat USA commended his pioneering work in mobile security with a Pwnie Award for Best Research.

### Sven Schleier

Sven is an experienced web and mobile penetration tester and assessed everything from historic Flash applications to progressive mobile apps. He is also a security engineer that supported many projects end-to-end during the SDLC to "build security in". He was speaking at local and international meetups and conferences and is conducting hands-on workshops about web application and mobile app security.

### Jeroen Willemsen

Jeroen is a principal security architect with a passion for mobile security and risk management. He has supported companies as a security coach, a security engineer and as a full-stack developer, which makes him a jack of all trades. He loves explaining technical subjects: from security issues to programming challenges.

### Carlos Holguera

Carlos is a mobile security research engineer who has gained many years of hands-on experience in the field of security testing for mobile apps and embedded systems such as automotive control units and IoT devices.
