[Nope-Proxy](https://github.com/summitt/Nope-Proxy) is an extension for Burp that operates as a Non-HTTP [Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM)](../../Document/0x04f-Testing-Network-Communication.md#intercepting-network-traffic-through-mitm) tool, allowing you to intercept both TCP and UDP traffic. Additionally, it allows DNS spoofing on mobile devices to redirect traffic to Burp for the interception of non-HTTP communications. It also includes features such as manual traffic interception, automated traffic manipulation, a Python mangler, and traffic highlighting.

It can be installed using the `.jar` file from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/summitt/Nope-Proxy/releases).
