apkx is a Python wrapper to popular free DEX converters and Java decompilers. It automates the extraction, conversion, and decompilation of APKs. Install it as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muellerberndt/apkx
cd apkx
sudo ./install.sh
```

This should copy apkx to `/usr/local/bin`.
