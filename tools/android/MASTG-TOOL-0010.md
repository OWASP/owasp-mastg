[APKLab](https://github.com/APKLab/APKLab "APKLab") is a convenient Visual Studio Code extension leveraging tools such as [apktool](MASTG-TOOL-0011.md) and [jadx](MASTG-TOOL-0018.md) to enable features including app unpacking, decompilation, code patching (e.g. for MITM), and repackaging straight from the IDE.

For more information, you can refer to [APKLab's official documentation](https://apklab.surendrajat.xyz/).
