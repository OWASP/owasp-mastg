## Identify Security-Relevant Contexts in Code

When developing a mobile application, it's crucial to accurately identify and handle security-relevant contexts within the codebase. These contexts typically involve operations such as authentication, encryption, and authorization, which are often the target of security attacks. Incorrect implementation of cryptographic functions in these areas can lead to significant security vulnerabilities.

Properly distinguishing security-relevant contexts helps in minimizing false positives during security testing. False positives can divert attention from real issues and waste valuable resources. Here are some common scenarios:

- **Random Number Generation**: Using random number generators with insufficient entropy can be a serious security flaw in contexts like authentication or encryption key generation, as predictable values can be exploited by attackers. However, not all uses of random numbers are security-sensitive. For example, using a less robust generator for non-security purposes, such as shuffling items in a game, is generally acceptable.

- **Hashing**: Hashing is often used in security for storing passwords or ensuring data integrity. However, hashing a non-sensitive value, like a device's screen resolution for analytics, isn't a security concern.

- **Encryption vs Encoding**: A common misunderstanding is conflating encoding (like Base64) with encryption. Base64 encoding is not a secure method for protecting sensitive data as it's easily reversible. It's crucial to recognize when data requires actual encryption (for confidentiality) versus when it's being encoded for compatibility or formatting reasons (like encoding binary data into a text format for transmission). Misinterpreting encoding as a security measure can lead to overlooking actual encryption needs for sensitive data.

- **API Token Storage**: Storing API tokens or keys in plain text within the app's code or in insecure locations (like SharedPreferences on Android or UserDefaults on iOS) is a common security mistake. However, if the token is for a non-sensitive, read-only public API, this might not be a security risk. Contrast this with storing a token for a sensitive or write-access API, where improper storage would be a significant security concern.
