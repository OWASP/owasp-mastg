This is the official GitHub Repository of the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). The MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the [OWASP Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs "MASVS").

- **Co-Author**: Consistently contribute quality content, [at least 2,000 additions logged](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/graphs/contributors "Co-author").
- **Top Contributor**: Consistently contribute quality content, [at least 500 additions logged](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/graphs/contributors "Top Contributor").
- **Contributor**: Any form of contribution, [at least 50 additions logged](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/graphs/contributors "Contributor").
- **Mini-contributor**: Everything below 50 additions, e.g. committing a single word or sentence.

[Contact us](#connect-with-us) (Sven Schleier (Slack: *Sven*) or Carlos Holguera (Slack: *Carlos*)) if you are planning to become an Author/Co-Author/Reviewer, are missing from the acknowledgements (note that we make updates frequently, but not in realtime).

## MSTG Translations

The MSTG is a living document that changes and adapts to the most recent security recommendations every day. While we do want to reach the maximum audience possible, our past experience shows that **maintaining translations has proven to be an extremely challenging task**. Therefore, please understand that **any PRs containing MSTG translations will be declined**, but you're free to do them on your own forks.

> 🇯🇵 A translation of the MSTG into Japanese is available on Github: <https://github.com/coky-t/owasp-mstg-ja>. Thanks to @coky-t for pushing this forward!

That said, we **strongly encourage [further translations of the MASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/blob/master/README.md#masvs-translations)** as it is much easier to maintain and you'll get a translated [Mobile App Security Checklists](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/releases/latest) mapping to the MSTG for free.

## About Hybrid Apps

Please note that the MSTG focuses primarily on native apps. These are apps built with Java or Kotlin using the Android SDK for Android or built with Swift or Objective-C using the Apple SDKs for iOS. Apps using frameworks such as Nativescript, React-native, Xamarin, Cordova, etc. are not within the main focus of the MSTG. However, some essential controls, such as certificate pinning, have been explained already for some of these platforms. For now, you can take a look and contribute to the work-in-progress being made in the discussions ["Hybrid application checklist experiments"](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/discussions/1971) and ["Basic Guidelines for Hybrid Apps"](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/discussions/557).
