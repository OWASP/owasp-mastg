    Your app uses TLS public key pinning without specifying a backup key.
    If you are forced to change TLS keys or CAs on short notice, not
    having a backup pin can lead to connectivity issues until you can push
    out an update. It is considered best practice to add at least one additional
    pin as a backup.

    Your app uses TLS public key pinning without specifying an expiration date.
    If your users do not update the app to receive new pins in time, expired or replaced
    certificates can lead to connectivity issues until they install an update.
    It is considered best practice to set an expiration time, after which the system will
    default to trusting system CAs and disregard the pin.
